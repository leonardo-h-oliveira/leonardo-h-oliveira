## About me
I hold a completed degree in the Interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science and Technology (BICT) from UNIFAL-MG. 
During my undergraduate studies, I served as an academic teaching assistant for Computational Resources I, II and III, 
working with Python and supporting students in programming logic.

As my undergraduate final project, I developed **UniCar**, a functional prototype of a university carpooling application, 
covering requirements analysis, system modeling, business logic, user authentication, 
and integration with a Firebase database.

I am currently a **Chemical Engineering and Data Science & Analytics (MBA) student** at **UNIFAL-MG and USP/ESALQ**, 
with a strong interest in working at the intersection of technology, data, and engineering.

## Technologies
